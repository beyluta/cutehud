![# cutehud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quickkennedy/cutehud/main/logo_transparent.png)

 
based off rayshud, takes heavy inspiration from reizu's krunker css <br>
uses a ton of stuff from budhud and hypnotize hud, plz dont kill me <br>
works on literally every resolution above 640x480 and on all standard aspect ratios from 5:4 to 21:9 out of the box. you dont need to move any files or rename a folder just because of your weird monitor.
